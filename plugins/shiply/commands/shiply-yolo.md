description: Ship it - commit to current branch and push (yolo mode)
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Ship these changes using the **yolo** scheme: commit to the current branch and push.

1. Review the changes above
2. Stage all relevant files with `git add` — never stage files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials, keys, etc.)
3. Create a single commit with a message that matches the repo's existing commit style
4. Push to origin on the current branch

Do this in as few tool calls as possible. Do not send any other text or messages besides tool calls.
